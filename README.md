# candor-trial

This is a Discord bot that allows users to create support tickets that are private, where people with a specific role can communicate with the user. The user can use (`!ticket`) to create a private channel, and ticket support agents can use the command (`!close`) to close a ticket.

## Setup

1. Install requirements:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Configure the `config.json` file to include your Discord bot token and Support Role ID:

```bash
nano config.json
```

3. Run the bot:

```
python3 main.py
```

And enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
